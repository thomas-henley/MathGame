# MathGame

## Introduction
In your first project you’ll build a very simple Math Game app. If this is your first time building a project indepentently, I recommend making use of the C# Academy's series from our C# Foundation area.This series will guide you through the process of creating a console app from the ground up, while explaining crucial C# concepts. If you have already watched it, or if you have prior experience creating C# applications, this project will be a breeze. But it’s still helpful to reinforce your knowledge.

You'll find challenges at the end of this project and all other projects in The C# Academy. These challenges aren't requirements. Your project will still be approved and you'll gain the correspondent experience points. However, the challenges will reinforce what you've learned. Although you might not get extra points for completing them, you'll become a better developer each time you finish a challenge.


## Requirements
- You need to create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations
- The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
- Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
- You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
- You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.


Tips
- Don't forget to ALWAYS, I mean ALWAYS have your code saved on Github (or whatever source control you use). This way you won't lose your work, and you can always refer back to it in the future. You're building a library of your own!
- Don't rush through the steps, even if this tutorial is easy for you. Make sure you understand EACH WORD of the code. Leave no stone unturned.
- If there's anything you don't understand, hover over the code, and you'll get an explanation of what the term means. If you still can't understand it, google is your best friend. You'll find explanations about pretty much everything in forums like stackoverflow.com.
- If this is your first project, I recommend doing it twice. You'll be surprised at how much your retention increases, and how many gaps were left in the first time.
- Upon completion of your project, go to our Discord community and brag about it! It's a very important step to complete a project and you should celebrate.

Challenges
- Try to implement levels of difficulty.
- Add a timer to track how long the user takes to finish the game.
- Add a function that let's the user pick the number of questions.
- Create a 'Random Game' option where the players will be presented with questions from random operations
